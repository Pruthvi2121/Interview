Algorithm -
   An algorithm is the set of instruction to to solve perticular problem.
   characterstics -
     1. Well defined defined input and output
     2. Each step should be clear and umbigious
     3. Lanaguage Independant.
     4. One problem can be solved in different ways using different algorithms.

Algorithm analysis 
The absoulate running time of an algorithm cannot be redicted, since it depends on a number of factors.
    1. Programming lanaugage 
    2. Operating System.
    3. programs running at same time


Algorithm analysiss contd
- We can evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size.
- Time Complexity -
  - Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a funtion of input size.
- Space Complexity -
  - Amount of space taken by an algorithm to run, as a funtion of input size.


- By evaluating the against  the input size, the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is 
also more appropriate.

Time Complexity
Asymptotic notations
-   Mathemeatical tools to represent time and space complexity
     -  Big-O Notation - Worst case complexity.
     -  Omega Notation - Best case complexity.
     -  Theta Notation - Average case complexity.

1. Big-O Notation
  - Big-O notation 
    - THe worst case coplexity of an algoirthm is represented using the Big-O notation
    - Big O notation describe the compleixty of an algorithm using algebraic terms.
    - It has two important characterstics
        - It is expressed in terms of input
        - It focuses on bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute detail
